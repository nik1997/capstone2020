# Forecasting Stock Returns in NYSE and NEPSE

This is my capstone project which includes code for forecasting stock returns in NYSE and NEPSE. The code includes replication of some models from Rapach et. al. (2013) paper (Forecasting Stock Returns). Then, I have also added Bayesian models trained using PyStan and a RNN-LSTM model.

The Rapach et. al. (2013) paper is available at: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444536839000062
The original code for Rapach et. al. (2013) paper is available at: https://sites.google.com/a/slu.edu/rapachde/DataProgramFilesHEF2013.zip
