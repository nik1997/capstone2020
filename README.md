# Financial Stock Modeling of NYSE and NEPSE

This project includes the replication of Rapach et. al. (2013) paper (Forecasting Stock Returns) which included models to forecast stock returns in NYSE from 1926 to 2010. I am extending the paper to include the up-to-date dataset and also extend it to Nepalese stock market.
